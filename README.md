Kaggle Human Resources Analytics

As part of my Data Science Practicum II, I am solving a human resource problem listed on Kaggle. The dataset contains 10 characteristics for 14999 employees for which some have left the company and some have remained. First, I summarize the data. Then I process the data to prepare for my learning algorithms (KNN, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, K-Means and SVM). The problems I am trying to solve for are what are the msot important reasons of why employees are leaving? Predict which employees will leave next.
